# Master Thesis

## Description

We investigated the relationship between four conversation dynamics (i.e., speaking time, turn length, speech rate, and response time) and perceived rapport in two online dyadic interaction settings: conversations and collaborations. This contributes to a deeper understanding of human social behaviour, with implications for enhancing both human-human and human-technology interaction.

Note: Due to confidentiality agreements, the dataset used in this thesis could not be shared.

## Files

The data analysis can be found in `data_analysis.ipynb`, with the results available in the `models` directory. A visualisation of the extracted conversation dynamics is provided in `dynamics.drawio`.

## Installation

To install the packages required for data analysis, please run this command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Credits

This code was developed by Quintine Sol as part of the master's thesis at the Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS), a collaboration between Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) and Tilburg University.
