# Master Thesis

## Description

We investigated the relationship between four conversation dynamics (i.e., speaking time, turn length, speech rate, and response time) and perceived rapport in two online dyadic interaction settings: conversations and collaborations. This contributes to a deeper understanding of human social behaviour, with implications for enhancing both human-human and human-technology interaction.
